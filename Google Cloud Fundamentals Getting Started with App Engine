#Google Cloud Fundamentals: Getting Started with App Engine

#Overview
#In this lab, you create and deploy a simple App Engine application using a virtual environment in the Google Cloud Shell.

#Objectives
#In this lab, you learn how to perform the following tasks:
#Initialize App Engine.
#Preview an App Engine application running locally in Cloud Shell.
#Deploy an App Engine application, so that others can reach it.
#Disable an App Engine application, when you no longer want it to be visible.


1:	Initialize App Engine

#Initialize your App Engine app with your project and choose its region:

	gcloud app create --project=$DEVSHELL_PROJECT_ID

#When prompted, select the region where you want your App Engine application located.


#Clone the source code repository for a sample application in the hello_world directory:

	git clone https://github.com/GoogleCloudPlatform/python-docs-samples


#Navigate to the source directory:

	cd python-docs-samples/appengine/standard_python3/hello_world



2.	 Run Hello World application locally	

#Ensure that you are at the Cloud Shell command prompt.
#Execute the following command to download and update the packages list.

	sudo apt-get update


#Set up a virtual environment in which you will run your application. Python virtual environments are used to isolate package installations #from the system.

	sudo apt-get install virtualenv

#If prompted [Y/n], press Y and then Enter.

	virtualenv -p python3 venv


#Activate the virtual environment.

	source venv/bin/activate


#Navigate to your project directory and install dependencies.

	pip install  -r requirements.txt

#Run the application:

	python main.py

#Please ignore the warning if any.
#In Cloud Shell, click Web preview (Web Preview) > Preview on port 8080 to preview the application.
#To access the Web preview icon, you may need to collapse the Navigation menu.

#Result:
	
	Hello World

#To end the test, return to Cloud Shell and press Ctrl+C to abort the deployed service.
#Using the Cloud Console, verify that the app is not deployed. In the Cloud Console, on the Navigation menu (Navigation menu), click App #Engine > Dashboard.
#Notice that no resources are deployed.	


3: Deploy and run Hello World on App Engine


#To deploy your application to the App Engine Standard environment:
#Navigate to the source directory:

	cd ~/python-docs-samples/appengine/standard_python3/hello_world

#Deploy your Hello World application.

	gcloud app deploy

#If prompted "Do you want to continue (Y/n)?", press Y and then Enter.
#This app deploy command uses the app.yaml file to identify project configuration.
#Launch your browser to view the app at http://YOUR_PROJECT_ID.appspot.com

	gcloud app browse

#Copy and paste the URL into a new browser window.

#Result:

	Hello World


4: Disable the application

#In the Cloud Console, on the Navigation menu (Navigation menu), click App Engine > Settings.
#Click Disable application.
#Read the dialog message. Enter the App ID and click DISABLE.
#If you refresh the browser window you used to view to the application site, you'll get a 404 error.
